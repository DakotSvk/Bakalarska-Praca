## Thesis Assignment

**Anotations:** This bachelor thesis investigates the potential of applying existing or emerging artificial intelligence techniques in the digital transformation of processes within state and public administration — it identifies concrete domains (registries, workflow systems, decision-making processes, verification automation, etc.) where AI could substantially lower transaction costs, streamline operations, and enhance service quality. The thesis also examines the obstacles to implementing these solutions (legal, ethical, technical), evaluates associated risks, and proposes strategies for optimal deployment in the Slovak public sector, drawing on current critiques of the state IT “underpinnings” and digitalization process shortcomings.
**Aim of the Thesis:** The aim of the thesis is to identify and analyze opportunities for applying artificial intelligence in the digital transformation of public administration processes, with an emphasis on reducing transaction costs and improving service efficiency.
